# 📡 Network Infrastructure Deployment using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project showcases a comprehensive network design implemented in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, demonstrating essential enterprise features such as **DHCP**, **SSH access**, **VoIP configuration**, and **end-to-end connectivity**.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This simulation covers the following key components:

- ✅ **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to end devices within the network.
- 🔐 **Secure Shell (SSH) Access**: Enables secure remote access to router CLI interfaces.
- 📞 **VoIP (Voice over IP)**: IP Phones are configured to communicate over the network, simulating voice communication.
- 📶 **Device Connectivity & Ping Test**: All end devices are tested for network connectivity using ICMP (ping).
- 🗺️ **Network Topology**: A logically segmented and scalable design using routers, switches, PCs, and IP phones.

## 🖥️ Features & Configuration

### 1. **Network Topology**
- Well-structured topology including:
  - Routers
  - Layer 2 switches
  - End devices (PCs, IP Phones)
- Logical addressing and interconnection between devices

### 2. **DHCP Configuration**
- DHCP enabled on Server
- Pool configuration includes:
  - IP range
  - Subnet mask
  - Default gateway
- Devices request and obtain IP addresses dynamically

### 3. **SSH Configuration**
- SSH access configured on router with:
  - Domain name
  - RSA key generation
  - Username/password setup
  - VTY lines configured for SSH only

### 4. **VoIP Connectivity**
- IP Phones connected and registered
- Each phone assigned a unique extension
- Phones can call each other within the network

### 5. **Connectivity Testing**
- Ping test between:
  - PCs across different subnets
  - Router interfaces
  - IP Phones
- Ensures full network communication

## 📁 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer (add if available).
2. Inspect the topology and open device CLI for configuration details.
3. Test connectivity by using **ping** and **IP Phone call simulation**.
4. Modify the design for learning and experimentation.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing
- Configure a central Call Manager for VoIP
- Add firewall rules for access control
- Implement DNS and web services for end devices
